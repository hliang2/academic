My name is Hao Liang(梁浩 in Chinese). I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Rice University, advised by Professor Guha Balakrishnan. Prior to that, I was a Research Associate at CyLab, CMU, supervised by Professor Giulia Fanti. I obtained my M.S. degree from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was fortunate to work with Professor Gauri Joshi and Professor Bhiksha Raj, and my Bachelor's degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. My research is in two broad areas: Speech & Image processing and distributed optimization.
